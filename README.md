## Description
Using node and mysql, I was able to create a command-line application in which one can view and add departments, roles, and employees. Once the application is launched, the user is presented with a main menu of options: view all employees, add employee, update employee role, view all roles, add role, view all departments, add department.

When a user wants to view all employees, a table appears of all employees (their role, salary, ID, managers). When a user wants to add an employee, they can input information via prompts. A user can also update an employee's role by going through a drop-down list of employees picking which employee's role to update and what to change it to. If a user wants to view all roles, a table of all roles displays. When a use wants to add a role, they are prompted to input a new role. When a user wants to view all departments, a table of all deparments displays. When a user wants to add a department, they are prompted to input a new department. All this information is updated to the tables. The user also has the option to quit.
